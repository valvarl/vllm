"""Aggregator rank attribution for load-failure reports (hardening H1).

The scheduler's cross-rank report consensus needs to name the
conflicting workers in its diagnostics; the only component that knows
which output came from which rank is the TP output aggregator. These
tests pin the stamping contract: every report the scheduler receives
carries the index of the worker that produced it, connectors never set
the tag themselves, and the repair-verdict channel is untouched.
